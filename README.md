# try-esy-skia
Example C++ program consuming esy-skia

## Notes

### Windows:
Expects esy-skia in the same level as this directory (this example dir and esy-skia must be siblings)
Expects MSVC (Community) installed at C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/2017/Community. Feel free to modify this.

### OSX/Linux
